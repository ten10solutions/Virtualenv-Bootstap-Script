 Quick and dirty script to create a virtualenv on a Windows desktop.
=====================================================================

This script will take a windows machine with nothing other than
Powershell and Python installed on it, and will install Pip and
Virtualenv on it.

It will then create a virtualenv, and create a shortcut on the Desktop
to it.
