Quick and dirty script to create a virtualenv on a Windows desktop.
===================================================================

**Warning:** Read this script before running it!  It may well be
destructive on your machine!

In training sessions, it's helpful to be able to get a lot of people
set up with a clean Python environment with a minimum of fuss. 

This script will take a windows machine with nothing other than
Powershell and Python installed on it, and will install Pip and
Virtualenv on it.  These are user installs, so it should not be
necessary to be a local administrator to run this.

Having installed these tools, it creates a virtualenv, and creates a
shortcut on the desktop to start cmd.exe with the virtualenv
activated.

From there you can start having users install software.

To use:

1. Update to fit your particular needs, and host somewhere (like Github)
2. Instruct your users to download the .ps1 and .cmd file (to their
   Desktops or somewhere else sensible).
3. Right click the Powershell script and uncheck the box that prevents
   downloaded files from being run.
4. Double click the batch script.
5. Check the output looks sensible, before pressing a key to allow it
   to close.
6. Double click shortcut.
7. Pip!
